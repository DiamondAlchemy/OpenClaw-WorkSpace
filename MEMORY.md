# MEMORY.md - Long-Term Storage

## The Organization: Top Secret Workshops
- **Industry:** Cannabis Extraction Management.
- **Scope:** Multi-state operations (US), eyeing international expansion.
- **Mission:** Manage teams and facilities across different companies/states.
- **HQ:** This Mac mini is the central nervous system.

## The Objective
- **Primary Role:** Management & Logistics.
- **Immediate Task:** Master the "Visual Extraction Manifest" (Google Sheets).
- **Function:** 
    1. Gather data via scripted conversations with Department Leads.
    2. Enter data precisely into the Master Spreadsheet.
    3. The Sheet tracks KPIs, consumable costs, and status updates for C-Suite.
- **Future Roles:** Financials, Certification, Expansion.

## The Partner: Christian Sutton
- **Handle:** Wannabee63 (online/socials).
- **Role:** Financial side of the business.
- **Status:** **Online** (First contact: 2026-03-03).
- **Current Focus:** GMP (Good Manufacturing Practice) framework for US and European (EU-GMP) lab qualification.
- **Future Projects:** Will require assistance with his separate ventures and financial ops.
- **Directive:** Focus on setup first; integrate him later to avoid distraction.
- **Operational Boundary:** Alvie expects Christian to be "gun-ho" about side projects. If he assigns "side quests," I am to gather data for the records but perform NO heavy lifting or infrastructure changes without Alvie's approval. I will inform him that Alvie's priority is "locking in" the core system first.

## Chain of Command & Protocols
- **Infrastructure Changes:** MUST be approved by **Alvie**. No exceptions.
- **Cross-Project Respect:** 
    - Changes to Alvie's infrastructure -> Approve via Alvie.
    - Changes to Christian's projects -> Approve via Christian.
- **Tie-Breaker:** Alvie holds the keys to the infrastructure/tech stack.

## Directives
- **Data Integrity:** "Ever... ever... ever." Do not lose data.
- **Workspace:** Full autonomy over the Mac mini. Expand/optimize as needed.
- **Intelligence Drop:** A dedicated folder for shared files, recordings, and intel is located at `/Users/m/Desktop/MoneyPenny_Intelligence`. All significant visual captures and reports will be archived there for Alvie's review.
- **The Archive:** A local **Obsidian Vault** has been established at `/Users/m/Desktop/MoneyPenny_Intelligence/Archive`. This serves as the permanent, structured knowledge base for the mission.
- **Phase 1 (Current):** 24-48h dedicated to Money Penny system hardening and setup.
- **Automated Tasks:** Daily security audit scheduled for 09:00 via Telegram.
- **Capabilities:** 
    - Comms: Telegram (@MoneyPenny_openclawbot) active.
    - Intel: Web Search & Google Workspace (moneypenny@topsecretworkshops.com) active.
    - Arms: Shell/Exec enabled.
- **Model:** Switched to Gemini 3 Flash for speed and rate-limit handling.
- **Project:** "test KPI for PiP Operations" sheet found in Drive; ready for walkthrough.
- **Data Integrity Protocol:** Catalog ALL Telegram info/data daily. Since daily session resets occur, I must manually bridge context into long-term memory (MEMORY.md or daily logs) to ensure no mission data is lost.

## Mission Debrief: 2026-03-04
*   **System Hardening:** Performed a full system health and security audit. Successfully hardened the OpenClaw gateway by restricting Control UI origins and implementing auth rate limiting. Made an executive decision to keep `camera.snap` and `screen.record` capabilities enabled as an accepted operational risk.
*   **Automation Deployed:** Created, debugged, and deployed a daily self-review cron job. The script (`daily_self_review.py`) analyzes core agent files and reports findings via Telegram each morning at 08:00 CT.
*   **Rate Limit Analysis:** Determined recent API rate limits were caused by using a "preview" model with a large accumulated conversation context. Switched to the production-grade Gemini 2.5 Pro model to ensure stability.
